# code_sample

#1)use the 10-k files from 2020 to 2022 to pretrain a bert model, then use Financial Phrase Bank to fine-tune the pretrained model. This process, modeled on the methodology used in the FinBERT paper(2023), serves as a practical exercise to familiarize with the procedures in NLP applied to finance, rather than aiming to develop models.

#2)generate LDA topics on 10-K text as was done in the paper "What are you saying? Using topic to detect financial misreporting."(only use 10-k text between and here)
